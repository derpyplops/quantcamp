          Trading Bootcamp teaches the fundamentals of quantitative trading: markets, order books, auctions, risk and sizing, adverse selection, arbitrage, and how quant trading firms make money.
          <br />
          <br />
          The philosophy of this bootcamp is that the best way to learn to trade is by trading. Weâ€™ll use a fake economy and exchange, run through many sessions of trading games designed to teach progressively more complex concepts, and auction off prizes at the end using our internal currency.
